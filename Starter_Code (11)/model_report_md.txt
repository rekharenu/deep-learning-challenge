Data preprocessing 

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
Ans: the target variable is the'IS_SUCCESSFUL'column from application_df

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
ANS:this was defined to drop the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL'column from original dataframe

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Ans: both'EIN' and 'NAME' column were dropped,because they are not targets or features dataset

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Ans: i used node_1 and node_2 layers as a random guessess from the iterate.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
Ans: i was not able to achive 75% in my model

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Ans: in addition i added more layers, removed columns, added hidden nodes to get more higher model accuracy.

Summary: 

Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve 
this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

Ans:In the deep learning model my accurate  is 78% . In  predicting . By using the higher correlation between input and output would get good results.
